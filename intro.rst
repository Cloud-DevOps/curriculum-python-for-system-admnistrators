Background Assumptions
======================

This class is designed for system administrators who will be using Python in the
course of their work.  It assumes students will have the following background
knowledge:

* Solid understanding of unix/posix system administration.

* Comfortable working on the command line.

* Basic understanding of networking and tools like SSH.

* Basic understanding of Python language and syntax.


Environment
===========

The following assumptions are made about the environment in which students will
be taking the course:

* Ubuntu 12.04.  All package installation etc examples assume you are working on
  an Ubuntu 12.04 desktop.  It should be possible to run all the code examples
  on other posix-compatible platforms, but additional or different setup may be
  required.
