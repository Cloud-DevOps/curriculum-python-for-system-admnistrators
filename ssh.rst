********************************
Remote control of hosts over SSH
********************************


subprocess.Popen()
==================

It is possible to control a local ssh session using ``subprocess.Popen()`` if no
libraries are available.  This is a super primative way to do things, and not
recommended if you can avoid it.

Here is an example: [#f1]_

.. literalinclude:: examples/ssh/popen_example.py
   :linenos:
   :lines: 8-
   
.. todo::

Fabric
======

Fabric is a library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for
application deployment or systems administration tasks.

It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell
commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as
auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or
aborting execution.


Basic Usage
-----------

Typical use involves creating a Python file named ``fabfile.py``, containing one
or more functions, then executing them via the fab command-line tool. Below is a
small but complete ``fabfile.py`` containing a single task:

.. literalinclude:: labs/fabric0/fabfile.py
   :lines: 5-


Once a task is defined, it may be run on one or more servers, like so:

.. code-block:: console

   (sysadmin)$ fab -H applebox,linuxbox host_type
   [applebox] run: uname -s
   [applebox] out: Darwin
   [linuxbox] run: uname -s
   [linuxbox] out: Linux
   
   Done.
   Disconnecting from localhost... done.
   Disconnecting from linuxbox... done.


Task arguments
==============

It's often useful to pass runtime parameters into your tasks, just as you might
during regular Python programming. Fabric has basic support for this using a
shell-compatible notation: ``<task name>:<arg>,<kwarg>=<value>,...``. It's
contrived, but let's extend the above example to say hello to you personally:
[#f2]_

::

   def hello(name="world"):
      print("Hello %s!" % name)


By default, calling ``fab hello`` will still behave as it did before; but now
we can personalize it:

.. code-block:: console

   (sysadmin)$ fab hello:name=Jeff
   Hello Jeff!
   
   Done.

Those already used to programming in Python might have guessed that this
invocation behaves exactly the same way:


.. code-block:: console

   (sysadmin)$ fab hello:Jeff
   Hello Jeff!
   
   Done.


For the time being, your argument values will always show up in Python as
strings and may require a bit of string manipulation for complex types such
as lists. Future versions may add a typecasting system to make this easier.




Aggregates
----------

Fabric can also be used to collect aggregate data about groups of hosts.
However this is not especially well supported, particularly when running from
the standard ``fab`` command.

.. literalinclude:: labs/fabric2/fabfile.py
   :linenos:
   :lines: 11-


Library Usage
-------------

In addition to use via the fab tool, Fabricâ€™s components may be imported into
other Python code, providing a Pythonic interface to the SSH protocol suite at a
higher level than that provided by e.g. the ssh library (which Fabric itself
uses.)

.. todo::

   Another, perhaps more complicated, Fabric example.
